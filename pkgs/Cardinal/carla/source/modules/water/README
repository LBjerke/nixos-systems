This folder contains 'water', a fork of Juce v.4x library code.
This fork takes out everything that is not needed for Carla, and makes it work on generic POSIX systems.

Using Juce version 4 means we can use its GPL v2+ license.
Starting from version 5, Juce uses GPLv3.

Do not use this library in your own code!
There are no plans to make it a generic library or give any support for its use outside of Carla.
