What is Carla?
---------------

Carla is a fully-featured audio plugin host, with support for many audio drivers and plugin formats.<br>
It's open source and licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 2 or later.

This repository contains external plugins not part of the default Carla source code.<br>
The reason for the split is to keep the main Carla code small, as these plugins are optional.<br>

Note that these plugins are not usable as-is, they require Carla.
