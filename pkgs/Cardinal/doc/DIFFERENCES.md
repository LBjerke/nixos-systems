# RACK PRO VS CARDINAL DIFFERENCES

This document describes the differences between Rack Pro plugin and Cardinal.  
It is not possible to know all the internal details of the official plugin due to it not being open-source,
so more technical details are best-guesses based on its behaviour.

The obvious big difference is that the official plugin is a commercial, closed-source product while Cardinal is free and open-source.

Also, the official plugin works pretty much like the free standalone where you login and download modules.  
This is intentionally not allowed/enabled in Cardinal, as the target is to make a self-contained plugin binary.
Online access is also not allowed.

Bellow follows a list of features comparing the official plugin to Cardinal.
