This is a special build of unzip's unzipfx tool, modified to allow full application bundles.
You get a static linked binary that extracts your files into a temporary location, then executes the main program (defined by you).

Currently working under Linux only, but should be fairly easy to get it into other OSes (unzip itself is already available in many, including Windows, MacOS, Linux and BeOS).


To get a static unzipfx application, you do:
 1 - create a zip file of your application bundle, with a single parent/root directory (this directory and the main app-name must match)
 2 - edit unzipfx/appDetails.h and set SFX_APP_MININAME as the directory name set in step 1
 3 - compile this tool using the appropriate makefile (eg: make -f Makefile.linux). That will give you 'unzipfx2cat' binary
 4 - concatenate your zip file over the 'unzipfx2cat' binary (eg: cat unzipfx2cat myapp.zip > myapp)
