# VCV Rack changelog

In this document, Ctrl means Cmd on Mac.

### 2.0.6 (2022-01-15)
- Add "Save a copy" to File menu.
- Remember CPU meter state across launches.
- Use audio device's suggested sample rate as initial sample rate.
- Add more logging of initialization/destruction of subsystems and module instantiation.
- Make MIDI input queue thread-safe, fixing probabilistic crash when processing MIDI input.
- Rack Pro
	- Generate MIDI Start message in DAWs like Cubase that pre-roll transport.
	- Generate MIDI Song Position Pointer messages when DAW is playing.
	- Fix VST2 input/output channel labels being truncated in Ableton Live.
	- Improve VST2 audio performance by avoiding unnecessary copying of buffers.

### 2.0.5 (2022-01-01)
- Swap order of parameter name and module name in MIDI-Map.
- Parse all note names from c0 to b9 and accidentals like c# and cb in parameter entry field.
- Tweak framebuffer render-skipping algorithm to always render at least 1 framebuffer after the frame deadline, to prevent framebuffers from never being rendered.
- Set audio device default sample rate to 44100, and block size to 256 except DirectSound to 1024.
- Fix file dialog truncating Unicode filenames on Mac.

### 2.0.4 (2021-12-18)

- Fix hidden window after closing while minimized and reopening.
- Move Import Selection menu item to File menu bar.
- Switch from GTK3 to `zenity` for opening dialogs on Linux.
- Implement prompt dialog on Windows.
- Make Windows installer add Rack to list of CFA allowed apps, allowing Rack to write to "My Documents" folder if Controlled Folder Access is enabled.
- Rack Pro
	- Improve stability of DAW MIDI clock.
	- Fix graphics glitch when duplicating module with Ctrl+D in Ableton Live.
	- Re-enable patch load error dialog.

### 2.0.0 (2021-11-30)
- Redesign Module Browser with compact layout, adjustable zoom levels, sorting options, intelligent searching, and multiple tag selection.

- Make scrollbar mouse interaction similar to modern OS behavior.
- Re-render framebuffers when subpixel offset changes, fixing bug that makes ports and knobs appear slightly offset at certain zoom levels.

- Add PulseAudio driver on Linux.
- Distribute .pkg installer on Mac.
- Check for VCV Library updates when Library menu is opened, rather than at time intervals.

	- Add `Module::configInput()` and `Module::configOutput()` for adding names to ports.
	- Replace `ParamWidget::paramQuantity` with `ParamWidget::getParamQuantity()`.
	- Add `.modules[].manualUrl` to plugin manifest schema.

	- Add `Engine::getNumModules()` and `Engine::getModuleIds()`.
	- Add `event::KeyBase::keyName`. Plugins should use this instead of `key` for alphanumeric keys in order to support all keyboard layouts.

	- Move event classes to inside `widget::Widget` class.
	- Deprecate `Window::loadSvg()`. Un-deprecate `Svg::load()`.
	- `Font` and `Image` can no longer be stored across UI frames. Load them with `APP->window->loadFont()` and `loadImage()` each `draw()` method.
	- Add `Widget::hasChild()`, `addChildBottom()`, `addChildBelow()`, `addChildAbove()`, and `drawChild()`.
	- Add `Module::createPatchStorageDirectory()` and `getPatchStorageDirectory()`.
	- Add `createMenuLabel()`, `createMenuItem()`, `createCheckMenuItem()`, `createBoolMenuItem()`, `createBoolPtrMenuItem()`, `createSubmenuItem()`, `createIndexSubmenuItem()`, and `createIndexPtrSubmenuItem()` to helpers.
	- Add `Module::onReset()` and `onRandomize()`. Overrides default param resetting and randomization behavior if overridden, unless super methods are called.
	- Add `Module::SaveEvent`.
	- Add operator overloads for `Vec`.
	- Add `string::join()`, `split()`, `formatTime()`, and `formatTimeISO()`.
	- Add `random::Xoroshiro128Plus` which can be used like C++ `<random>` classes.
	- Add `Port::getVoltageRMS()`.
	- Add `Widget::drawLayer()` for handling multiple draw passes.

	- Add `dsp::convert()` template functions for converting audio between normalized floats and integers.
	- Add `bool app::SvgSwitch::latch` setting for latching button switches.
