# Valley

3rd party plugins for VCV Rack version 2.0.x

## Version

2.0.3

## Compatibility

The modules are Mac, Windows and Linux compatible. Some source is inherently open source, so you are free to download / clone and build on your own computer. See the appropriate license information for more details.

You must have at least Rack v2.0.x use these modules.

## Modules

* Topograph - A port of the Mutable Instruments "Grids", the rhythm sequencer module that was missing from the VCV Audible Instruments plugin bundle. Covered by GPL-3.0 license.
* ÂµGraph - Same as Topograph except more compact. It does, however, default to the Olivier pattern modes rather than Henri.
* Dexter - An FM wavetable oscillator with tonnes of modulation inputs, phase shaping and synchronisation options, as well multiple outputs from 2 separate voices and each operator.
* Plateau - A plate reverb with a twist. Can add large expansive textures to your
sounds, as well as be able to be tuned and excited at very short reverb times. It is based on the
well known Dattorro (1997) plate reverb algorithm.
* Amalgam - A signal masher and multipler
* Interzone - A complete, monophonic, virtual analogue synth voice
* Terrorform - A wavetable oscillator based of the operator section of Dexter, but far more enhanced. Allows for loading of user wavetables.
