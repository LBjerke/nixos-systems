Things for future releases perhaps?

Plugins:
* LSFR more general noise maker (sort of started in the ChipSym)
* CleverClipper (branch "CleverClipper" already exists on mac and in dbox)
* Lilypond or ABC-like music phrase generator
* This paper looks fun https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/68fa/415703af07042d4301ac6cb3722c87f5bc43.pdf
* Karplus Strong Mono
* KSPoly gets built in trigger delay and button
* Gates in QuantEyes
* Add appropriate BaconHelpButtons to everything
* Keep or kill that sloppy chorus
* Granular synthesis? (BencinaAudioEnecdotes pdf)
* Phaser with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-pass_filter
* Can I factor so all of these are also AUs?
