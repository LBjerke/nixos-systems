# Contribution guide

I welcome contributions to these plugins and am happy to review pull requests with changes. 

I'm mostly writing this document so I can get a "checkmark" on the github opensource project
health checklist. I don't think any of you will do big development on this plug set, but I am
happy if you want to!

Here's some thoughts on how that would work, but the project is small enough that we can just sort of sort it 
in an issue if you are interested in doing something big.

* Before you start developing, please open a github issue to chat with me about the change you
want to make. While you don't have to do this, it's probably best since then at least I'm not
surprised by your PR. *GitHub Issues are by far the best way to reach me about this project*.
* The plugin is licensed under Apache 2. If you aren't comfortable working under that license,
then we should chat. I'm happy for you to retain copyright for your changes if you want and
they are substantial (vs something tiny I could just fix myself if you mentioned it).
* Please see the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for community guidelines.
