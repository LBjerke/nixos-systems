# Code of Conduct

The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html) is an excellent code of
conduct, and one by which I'd like to hope I carry myself. Please read it and follow its guidance when
working with this project.

BaconPlugs is mostly a one-person project, but I do welcome and appreciate all feedback. 
Please use the
github issue mechanism to start discussions or leave comments. Your comments will be more gladly
recieved if they are constructive, polite,
and empathetic, and I will aspire to be constructive, polite, and empathetic in my responses.

I cannot, however, guarantee that my responses will always be very *timely*. 
This is just a little side project for me! 

I hope that you are also as excited to make music using open tools as I am, and hope that
you want to make that a positive, inclusive experience.
