# Glue the Giant's Modular Bus Mixers for VCV Rack

These mixers provide send effects, fade automation, solo, mixer groups, group auditions, effect auditions, pop filters, mixer preamps, two polyphonic stereo spread modes, and integrated latency compensation.
To chain the mixers, simply connect the BUS OUT and BUS IN ports.

The audio between modules is routed along three stereo buses: red, orange, and blue.
This bus design makes it easy to patch together a simple mixer or complex audio routing similar to what can be found in modern DAWs.
Using modular mixers can make your mixing more intuitive.

## Acknowledgments 

Thanks to Andrew Belt (Vortico) for the VCV Rack software and its community of developers, tweakers, and musicians.

Thanks to all the other Rack coders, especially those who share their code.
You are too numerous to thank individually, but I tried to star all of your repos and have started to include acknowledgments in the code.
Thanks for the early encouragement from users, like Aria_Salvatrice, dag2099, browneditor, and chaircrusher, who displayed the use of the Modular Bus Mixers in published songs and videos.
That early encouragement made me want to make them more feature complete with better code under the hood.
Thanks to rsmus7 for beta testing.
Thanks to Omri Cohen for the videos that helped inspire these modules.
Finally, thanks always to Rebecca.

The developer thought parameters were being saved by their names.
He now knows parameters are saved by their order.
